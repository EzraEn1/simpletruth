# ANTICHRIST

## 1 - WHAT WILL HAPPEN BEFORE JESUS RETURNS? *2 THESSALONIANS 2:3-4*

Before the return of Jesus there will be a "*falling away*" (v. 3) from within Christianity through the "*man of sin*" or "*son of perdition*" (v. 3). These are just some of the many names attributed to the Antichrist of the Bible. The Antichrist is a "*Christian*" power that puts itself in the place of Christ.

## 2 - WHAT DOES DANIEL SEE COMING OUT OF THE SEA? *DANIEL 7:3-7*

Daniel sees four beasts. The first is a lion with eagle's wings, the second is a bear with three ribs in its mouth, the third is a leopard with four heads and wings, and the fourth beast is "*dreadful and terrible*" and has "*ten horns*" (v. 7).

## 3 - WHAT DO THESE BEASTS REPRESENT? *DANIEL 7:17*

As we have seen in a previous study, these beasts represent the four kingdoms that arise one after the other in Daniel 2. The lion represents Babylon, the bear– Medo-Persia, the leopard– Greece, the fourth beast– Rome, and the 10 horns– Europe. Daniel is repeating information previously given, but in this vision new information is added.

## 4 - WHAT IS NEW IN THIS VISION? *DANIEL 7:8*

Daniel sees another horn (kingdom)– a little one – arising, which is different from all the others. This little horn represents the Antichrist.

## 5 - WHO IS THE ANTICHRIST? *DANIEL 7:8, 24-25*

1. "*Another shall arise after them…*" (v. 24). The Antichrist arises after the division of Rome which took place by 476 A.D.

2. "*Coming up among them…*" (v. 8). The Antichrist comes from the divided Roman empire (Europe).

3. "*Shall subdue three kings…*" (v. 24). Three kingdoms are destroyed as the Antichrist rises to power.

4. "*He shall speak pompous words against the Most High…*" (v. 25). The Antichrist is a blasphemous power (see Mark 2:7 & John 10:33). The biblical definition of blasphemy is claiming prerogatives that belong only to God (e.g. claiming to be able to forgive sins).

5. "*Persecute[s] the saints of the Most High…*" (v. 25). The Antichrist persecutes God's true followers.

6. "*Intend to change times and law…*" (v. 25). Tries to change the 10 commandments, particularly the one that relates to time, i.e. The Sabbath.

7. "*For a time and times and half a time…*" (v. 25). The Bible employs the "day for a year" principle in prophecy (Ezekiel 4:6; Numbers 14:34), making this a 1260-year period in which the Antichrist power reigns. There is only one power in history that fits all of these points – the Roman Catholic Church/State (for more information see supplied handout).

## 6 - WHO WILL THE ANTICHRIST DECEIVE? *2 THESSALONIANS 2:9-10*

The antichrist will deceive those who do not have a "*love of the truth*". Having a love for the
truth means that we make the Bible the only foundation for our lives and bring everything into
alignment with it. 

**Satan has used the Antichrist to deceive and confuse many people, but God is leading His people back to the Bible. Will you choose to love the truth, and be saved? Won't you commit to making His**

# SUPPLEMENT

## (1-3) RISES TO POWER AFTER 476 A.D | FROM ROME | SUBDUES THREE
No one would argue that the Roman Catholic Church proceeded from Rome. After the division of Rome, the Emperor Justinian issued a decree later known as "Justinian's Decree," which set up and acknowledged the Bishop of Rome as the head of all churches. It gave the papacy civil power as well as ecclesiastical power. Three Arian kingdoms withstood the decree – the Heruli, the Ostrogoths, and the Vandals. Subsequently, the Roman armies attacked and "uprooted" these kingdoms, the last of which was the Ostrogoth power, defeated in 538 A.D. This paved the way for Justinian's decree to go into effect, and Pope Vigilius ascended to the papal throne. 

## (4) A BLASPHEMING POWER

"God Himself is obliged to abide by the judgment of His priest, and either not to pardon or to pardon, according as they refuse or give absolution… The sentence of the priest precedes, and God subscribes to it." – *St. Alphonsus Liguori, Dignity and Duties of the Priest, Vol. 12, p. 2.*

"We hold upon this earth the place of God Almighty." – *Encyclical Letters of Leo XIII, p. 304.*

"The Pope is not only the representative of Jesus Christ, but he is Jesus Christ Himself hidden under the veil of flesh. Does the Pope speak? It is Jesus Christ who speaks." – *Archbishop of Venice prior to becoming Pope Pius X, Catholic National, July, 1895.*

## (5) A PERSECUTING POWER 

"That the Church of Rome has shed more innocent blood than any other institution that has ever existed among mankind, will be questioned by no Protestant who has a competent knowledge of history… It is quite certain that no power of imagination can adequately realize their sufferings." – *History of the Rise and Influence of the Spirit of Rationalism in Europe, Vol. II, p. 32.*

## (6) ATTEMPTS TO CHANGE THE TEN COMMANDMENTS

"The Pope is of so great authority and power that he can modify, explain, or interpret even Divine laws…" – *Translated from Lucius Ferraris Prompta Biliotheca, art. "Papa," II, Vol. 5, pp. 26-9.* 

The Ten Commandments as printed in the Catholic Catechism deletes the second commandment regarding idol worship and moves the fourth commandment to the third, the fifth to the fourth, and so on, finally dividing the tenth commandment into two parts in order to keep the number ten.

"Like two sacred rivers flowing from paradise, the Bible and divine tradition contain the Word of God… Though these two divine streams are… of equal sacredness… still, of the two, tradition is to us the more clear and safe." – *Joseph Faa Di Bruno, Catholic Belief, p. 33.*

## (7) REIGNS FOR 1260 YEARS

Napoleon's general Berthier captured the Pope in 1798 and had him exiled to Valence, France, where he died in captivity.

"Berthier entered Rome on the 10th of February, 1798, and proclaimed a republic."– *The Modern Papacy, p. 1, London: Catholic Truth Society*

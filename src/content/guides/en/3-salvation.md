# SALVATION

## 1 - WHAT IS SIN? *1 JOHN 3:4*

The only definition of sin is disobeying God's law. God's law (the 10 commandments, Exodus 20:2-17) is the objective standard for righteousnessâ€“ showing us what is right and what is wrong. Its
principles cover every conceivable sin.

## 2 - HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE SINNED? *ROMANS 3:23*

The Bible says that every person who has ever lived has sinned.

## 3 - WHAT DO WE DESERVE, AND IS THERE HOPE? *ROMANS 6:23*

Wages and gifts are two very different things. A wage is what you earn in consequence for what you've done. A gift is something that you receive that you don't deserve (Ephesians 2:8-10). As sinners, we have "earned" death as both a consequence and a penalty. However, instead of death, we are given the gift of life which we don't deserve. Despite our condition, we have hope.

## 4 - WHY CAN JESUS OFFER US THIS GIFT? *ISAIAH 53:4-6*

Jesus took our sins and died in our place so that we may live. He is able to spare us from what we deserve because He took the penalty for our sins.

## 5 - WHY WOULD GOD DO THIS FOR YOU? *JOHN 3:16*

Because He loves you.

## 6 - HOW DO YOU RECEIVE THIS GIFT? *1 JOHN 1:9*

We need to recognise that we have sinned and confess those sins to Jesus. After we have asked for forgiveness, we can/should believe that we have been forgiven. When we do this, we can have the assurance of salvation. This doesn't mean that we'll never sin again, but that we have chosen the path of repentance by turning away from sin.

## 7 - WHAT IS JESUS WAITING FOR YOU TO DO? *REVELATION 3:20*
Jesus is waiting for you to invite Him into your lives.

**The choice is yours. Jesus wants to give you a new life. He wants you to have the assurance of eternal life today! Won't you open the door and invite Him in just now?**

*"Dear heavenly Father, I'm a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe that Jesus died in my place. I want to trust Him as my Saviour and follow Him as my Lord. Today I want to invite You into my life. Thank You for what You've done for me. I pray this in the name of Jesus. Amen."*

# SABBATH

## 1 - DOES THE LORD HAVE A SPECIAL DAY? *REVELATION 1:10*

Yes, this day is called the *'Lord's day'* and it is different from every other day of the week. Let's find out what the Bible has to say about this day.

## 2 - JESUS IS THE LORD OF WHICH DAY? *MARK 2:27-28*

Jesus calls Himself the *"Lord of the Sabbath"* (v. 28). The Sabbath is so important to Jesus that He calls Himself the Lord of it.

**Note:** Jesus also says that *"the Sabbath was made for man"* (v. 27) which means that this special day is for everyone.

## 3 - WHAT IS THE SABBATH? *EXODUS 20:8-11*

*"The seventh day is the Sabbath"* (v. 10). Clearly, Sabbath is the seventh day of the week, which is Saturday. There are over 104 languages in the world whose name for the seventh day is "Sabbath"

**Note:** A biblical day runs from sunset to sunset, not midnight to midnight (see Genesis 1:5, 8, 13, 19, 23). Therefore Sabbath runs from Friday evening till Saturday evening.

## 4 - WHEN WAS THE SABBATH GIVEN? *GENESIS 2:1-3*

After Jesus had finished His work of creation (see Colossians 1:15-16), He rested on the seventh day, then blessed the Sabbath and made it holy.

## 5 - DID JESUS KEEP THE SABBATH? *LUKE 4:16*

Jesus kept the Sabbath. It was His custom to go to the synagogue (church) on this day.

## 6 - WAS THE SABBATH DONE AWAY WITH? *ACTS 13:14, 42-44*

There is an abundance of evidence in the New Testament that the followers of Jesus kept the seventh-day Sabbath after Jesus' death (see Luke 23:56). Just like Jesus, the apostle Paul's custom was to worship on the Sabbath day, even when there was no synagogue around (see Acts 16:13, also Acts 17:2 & 18:4). Jesus clearly expected His followers to keep the Sabbath long after His death (see Matt 24:20).

## 7 - WILL WE KEEP THE SABBATH IN HEAVEN? *ISAIAH 66:22-23*

Even when God creates a new heaven and earth, we will worship Him on His special dayâ€“ the Sabbath.

**Jesus invites us to love Him with all our hearts and follow Him regardless of anything else. Are you willing to remember the Sabbath and keep it holy?**

# MARK OF THE BEAST

## 1 - WHAT DOES REVELATION WARN US OF? *REVELATION 14:9-11*

The mark of the beast is accompanied by the most fearful denunciation of wrath given in all of Scripture. However, nobody can determine what this mark is until they determine who the beast is.

## 2 - WHO IS THE BEAST? *REVELATION 13:2, 5, 7*

The little horn in Daniel 7 and the first beast in Revelation 13 are describing the same power. (see Antichrist study). This beast is the Roman Church-State also known as the Papacy.

## 3 - WHAT IS THE CENTRAL ISSUE? *REVELATION 13:4, 8, 12, 15, 14:7, 9, 11*

Worship is mentioned 8 times in these two chapters. From the context it is clear that the mark of the beast is an issue of worship. This issue revolves around a specific day of worship (Sabbath or Sunday). Therefore, it cannot be a chip or a tattoo.

## 4 - HOW DO WE KNOW THAT SABBATH IS THE ISSUE? *REVELATION 14:7*

1. Revelation directly quotes the Sabbath commandment (Exodus 20:11).
2. The Antichrist attempts to "*change times and laws*" (Daniel 7:24), and the Sabbath is the only commandment connected to time.
3. Those who receive this mark are contrasted with those who "*keep the commandments of God.*" (Revelation 14:12).

## 5 - WHAT DOES THE BEAST CLAIM IS ITS MARK OF AUTHORITY?
"Q. – Have you any other way of proving that the Church has power (authority) to institute festivals or precept?

A. – Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her; she could not have substituted the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which there is no Scriptural Authority." – *Stephen Keenan, Doctrinal Catechism, p. 174.*

**Note:** If the Antichrist's mark is Sunday, then God's seal must be the Sabbath.

## 6 - HOW DOES THE BEAST ENFORCE HIS MARK? *REVELATION 13:14-17*
<!-- TODO: Link USA study -->
The Antichrist uses the second beast to enforce its mark globally (see USA in Prophecy). The second beast will enforce Sunday worship through deception, political and economic pressure, followed by heavier penalties, and finally a death decree. The Sabbath is the final test that reveals who is sincerely in Jesus.

**Note:** Nobody has the mark of the beast now. The Mark of the Beast is received only when Sunday
worship is enforced.

## 7 - HOW ARE GOD’S PEOPLE IDENTIFIED AT THIS TIME? *REVELATION 14:12*
They follow God’s commandments and have the faith of Jesus. 

**God is looking for people who will "*Follow the Lamb wherever He goes*" (Revelation 14:4). This includes keeping the Sabbath. Don’t you want to beamong those people and keep His Sabbath now?**

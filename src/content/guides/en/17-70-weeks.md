# 70 WEEKS

## 1 - WHAT WAS DANIEL'S VISION ABOUT? *DANIEL 9:24*

This vision is about a prophetic time (70 weeks) for Daniel's people (Israel). These 70 weeks are 490 prophetic days which are equivalent to 490 literal years when applying the day for a year principle (Ezekiel 4:6, Number 14:34).

## 2 - WHO DOES THIS PROPHECY POINT TO? *DANIEL 9:25*

Messiah. The decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem was given in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes reign (Ezra 7:7) in 457 B.C.. Exactly 483 years after this date, Messiah would be anointed and begin His ministry in 27 A.D..

**Note:** 69 prophetic weeks or 483 prophetic days is equivalent to 483 literal years. Therefore, 483 years from 457 B.C. brings us to the year 27 A.D., when Messiah would come.

## 3 - WHEN DID MESSIAH COME? *LUKE 3:21-22, 1*

Jesus, the Messiah came right on time. He was anointed at His baptism (Acts 10:37-38) in the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar which was 27 A.D.. When Jesus began His ministry, He referred to Daniel's prophecy by declaring that "*the time is fulfilled!*" (Mark 1:15).

## 4 - WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO MESSIAH? *DANIEL 9:26-27*

"*In the midst of the week*" (v.27) Messiah would be cut off. That is, 3 Â½ years into the final 7 years of the prophecy, Jesus would be crucified. This would "*bring an end to sacrifice and offering*" in the spring of 31 A.D.. When Jesus died, the veil separating the Holy and Most Holy compartments in the temple was torn from top to bottom, thus demonstrating an end of the earthly sacrificial system (Matthew 27:50-51).

## 5 - WHAT HAPPENED TO AT THE END OF 490 YEARS? *ACTS 7:59, 8:1, 4*

Stephen appealed to the Sanhedrin (the highest Jewish authority), to repent and accept Jesus. Instead, they rejected this appeal and stoned him. Their time of probation as a chosen nation had come to an end. Now we find that it is the church who is the "*chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people*" (1 Peter 2:9).

**Note:** God has not rejected or cursed Jewish people. Just like with every people group, He desires to save every Jew who accepts Him as Lord and Saviour. (See Romans 2:10, 11)

## 6 - WHY DID GOD GIVE THIS PROPHECY TO DANIEL? *DANIEL 9:21-23*

Daniel did not understand the prophecy that God had given him in Daniel 8 (Daniel 8:27), so Gabriel came to give him understanding regarding this.

**God wanted us to know when our Saviour would come, and Jesus came right on time. He is the only true Messiah. He was cut off not for Himself, but for you. Would you like to give your sins to Jesus?**

# 70 WEEKS SUPPLEMENT

<!-- TODO: 70 weeks supplement timeline image -->

**457 B.C.**

The decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem was given in the seventh year of Artaxerxes (Ezra 7:7).
It was part of the three decrees made, and the only decree which restored Jewish government (Ezra 6:14).

**27 A.D.**

The Bible says that Jesus' baptism occured in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar - 27A.D. When Jesus began preaching, He began His message by declaring that "the time is fullfilled!"
He was refferring directly to the prophecy of the 70 weeks.

**31 A.D.**

We know that there were four Passovers during Jesus' ministry, the first about 6 months after His baptism, and the fourth and final one at the time of His crucifixion. He was the passover lamb (1 Corinthians 5:7). The final week of the prophecy began at the baptism of Jesus in the autumn of 27 A.D. Three and a half years would bring us to the spring of 31 A.D.

**34 A.D.**

The seventy weeks came to an end in the fall of 34 A.D. when the Jewish Sanhedrin stoned Stephen to death.

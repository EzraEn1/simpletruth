# LIFESTYLE

## 1 - WHY SHOULD WE CARE FOR OUR HEALTH? *1 CORINTHIANS 6:19-20*

Our bodies are a temple for the Holy Spirit, and God is concerned with how we care for them. We are called to surrender every part of our lives to Him.

## 2 - WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT? *PHILIPPIANS 4:8*
All behaviour, whether good or bad, begins in the mind (Luke 6:45). We should train our minds to dwell upon things that are pure, true, virtuous, and uplifting.

## 3 - WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY ABOUT DRUGS? *ROMANS 14:21*

Christians should avoid the use of all alcohol, illicit drugs and tobacco (Proverbs 20:1, 23:29-33, Isaiah 5:22) because of our witness to those around us. The Bible states that we are to: "*Be sober… because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.*" (1 Peter 5:8). Anything that damages our body, interferes with our ability to reason, or causes others to stumble, must be surrendered.

## 4 - WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY ABOUT WHAT WE EAT? *LEVITICUS 11:3-4, 9-10*

God originally gave humanity a plant-based diet (Genesis 1:29). However, after the flood, God allowed humanity to consume some (but not all) meats. Even before the flood, the distinction between clean animals (can be eaten) and unclean animals (can't be eaten) was given (Gen 7:2-3). Clean animals chew the cud and have divided hooves (sheep/cows/deer, not pigs/rabbits), have both fins and scales (bream/snapper, not clams/prawns), or are foraging birds (chickens/turkeys, not bats/emus). The Bible tells us: "*whether you eat or drink… do all to the glory of God.*" 1 Cor 10:31.

## 5 - WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY ABOUT MARRIAGE? *HEBREWS 13:4*

The marriage relationship between a man and a woman is the only appropriate context for sexual intimacy. Viewing sexually explicit material is a violation of God's law against adultery (Matthew 5:28). Scripture also warns against entering into relationships with unbelievers (2 Corinthians 6:14).

## 6 - WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY ABOUT MONEY? *MALACHI 3:8-10*

God calls all of us to return a part of our income back to Him. Tithe is 10% of our income that we return to God for ministry. Returning tithe is a test of faith, but God gives us the assurance of His blessing! Tithe is different from offerings (free-will gifts that we choose to give to God).

## 7 - IN LIGHT OF THIS, HOW DOES GOD ASK YOU TO LIVE? *TITUS 2:11-14*

We have been saved and called to a higher standard so we can have a more abundant life and be a witness to those around us. The only way to experience this is to surrender all to Jesus.

**God created us to be happy, joyful, and content. Not only does He show us the pathway to happiness, but He also promises to give us the power to walk that pathway. Do you want to choose to give Jesus your lifestyle today?**

# DEATH

## 1 - ARE HUMANS IMMORTAL? *1 TIMOTHY 6:15-16*

No. God is the only one who is immortal. The Bible teaches that humans seek immortality (Romans 2:6-7). You would never look for something that you already have. Humans seek for immortality, therefore humans are not immortal.

## 2 - WHAT IS A SOUL? *GENESIS 2:7*

According to Scripture a soul is a combination of the "*dust of the ground*" and "*the breath of life*" (v. 7). A soul only exists when these two components (body & breath) are together. We don't have souls, we are souls. Therefore, a soul (living being) can die (Ezekiel 18:4).

## 3 - WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DIE? *GENESIS 3:19*

A common deception is that we go straight to heaven or hell as soon as we die. But, the Bible is clear that when a person dies they "*return to the ground*" (v. 19).

## 4 - IS THERE ANY CONSCIOUSNESS IN DEATH? *ECCLESIASTES 9:5-6*

No. The dead know and feel nothing. They don't praise or worship God in heaven (Psalms 6:5 & 115:17), nor do they return to their homes to visit family or friends (Job 7:9-10). The Bible is repeatedly clear that when we die, we don't go straight to heaven (Acts 2:29, 34).

## 5 - WHAT DOES THE BIBLE LIKEN DEATH TO? *JOHN 11:11-13*

Jesus referred to death as a sleep.. Death is described as a sleep more than 50 times throughout Scripture. Since death is like sleep (see Psalms 13:3), there is also no sense of time passing since there is no consciousness in death. Experientially, it will feel as if we pass from death to life instantly, even though it may have been many years.

## 6 - IS DEATH THE END? *1 THESSALONIANS 4:15-17*

Absolutely not. The wonderful hope for those who are in Jesus is that they will be resurrected at His second coming. Death is not the end for those who believe, as Jesus is the "*resurrection and the life*" (John 11:25).

**Note:** There would be no purpose in a resurrection if we were already in heaven.

## 7 - SHOULD CHRISTIANS FEAR DEATH? *1 CORINTHIANS 15:51-55*

No. For Christians, death is not to be feared. We will be resurrected at the sound of the last trumpet and will be given new, incorruptible bodies. Death itself will ultimately be destroyed!

**God has given us hope beyond the graveâ€“ the hope of eternal life. He doesn't want us to be afraid. Many have been tormented over this subject. But Scripture is clear. We do not need to fear death. Will you choose to put your future in the hands of Jesus?**

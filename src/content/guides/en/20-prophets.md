# PROPHETS


## 1 - WHAT IS A PROPHET? *JEREMIAH 1:5, 9*

A prophet is a spokesperson for God. They speak with prophetic authority and provide comfort, guidance, instruction, and correction to the church. They do not merely predict the future.

## 2 - HAS THE MINISTRY OF PROPHETS ENDED? *EPHESIANS 4:11-15*

No. The Bible is clear that the gift of prophecy, just like all other spiritual gifts, will be around until Jesus returns (see Joel 2:28).

## 3 - WHAT SHOULD WE DO WITH PROPHETS? *1 THESSALONIANS 5:19-21*

We are called to test them. If they are true, we must accept them. If they are false, we must reject them. 

## 4 - HOW DO YOU TEST A PROPHET?

Examine their message in light of these questions:
- Do they align and submit to Scripture? (Isaiah 8:20)
- Do they belong to God's church? (1 Corinthians 14:22)
- Do they teach that Jesus was both God and man (incarnation)? (1 John 4:1-3)
- Do they bear the fruit of the Holy Spirit in their lives? (Matthew 7:20)

## 5 - WILL THERE BE PROPHETS IN THE LAST DAYS? *REVELATION 12:17, 19:10, 22:8-9*

Yes. The "testimony of Jesus" refers to the spiritual gift of prophecy. Just as the Old Testament church had prophets (Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Amos, etc.) and the New Testament church had prophets (Acts. 11:27; 13:1; 15:32; 21:9-10), so God's end-time church has the gift of prophecy. 

**Do you agree that scripture teaches that the gift of prophecy will be
present until the coming of Christ?**

**The Seventh-day Adventist Church believes that this gift was manifested in the ministry of Ellen G. White. Are you willing to test her writings to see for yourself whether or not she is a true prophet?**

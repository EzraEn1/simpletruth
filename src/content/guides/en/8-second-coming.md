# SECOND COMING

## 1 - WHAT DID JESUS PROMISE HIS FOLLOWERS? *JOHN 14:1-3*

In this passage Jesus promises us two things: 
1. That He is preparing a place for us in heaven, and 
2. that He will one day come and take us to this place in heaven.

## 2 - HOW WILL JESUS RETURN? *ACTS 1:9-11*

The angels told the disciples that Jesus would return in the same way He left. The disciples "*watched*" (v9) and "*looked steadfastly toward heaven*"(v10) until Jesus was taken "*out of their sight*" (v9). Jesus' return is a literal event.

## 3 - WHO WILL BE ABLE TO SEE JESUS' RETURN? *REVELATION 1:7*

Jesus' return will be seen by every person on earth. It will not be a secret.

## 4 - HOW MANY WILL HEAR HIM? *1 THESSALONIANS 4:16-17*

All, even the dead believers in Jesus will hear those great sounds of His second coming- "*a shout … the voice of an archangel, and … the trumpet of God*" (v16). After these sounds they will be raised to life and we will all meet Jesus together in the air. Jesus won't touch the ground when He returns.

## 5 - WHO IS COMING WITH JESUS? *MATTHEW 25:31*

Jesus will be accompanied by all the angels of heaven.
**Note:** Jesus is coming back for the dead- they are not accompanying Him at the second coming.

## 6 - DO WE KNOW EXACTLY WHEN THIS DAY WILL BE? *2 PETER 3:10-13*

No (see also Matthew 24:36). A thief does not tell you when they are going to rob you. The
description of the thief describes the timing of the event, not the nature of it, which "*will pass away
with a great noise*" (v10). Although the timing is unknown, we have been given instruction to live
lives of "*holy conduct and godliness*" (v11) in preparation for this day.

## 7 - HOW CAN WE PREPARE FOR THIS DAY? *MATTHEW 24:44*

Jesus tells us to "*be ready*" because the second coming is something that many will not expect. Sadly, many will not be ready when Jesus returns because they have not made Him the Lord and Saviour of their lives. Yet, we can choose to be ready for this great day by having a relationship with Jesus.

**The Bible is clear that Jesus is going to return to bring us home to the place He's been preparing for us. Nobody will be ready for that day unless they choose now to be ready. Are you willing to give God permission to prepare your heart today? Do you want to live for Jesus?**

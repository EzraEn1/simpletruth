# LAW

## 1 - CAN WE BE SAVED BY KEEPING THE LAW? *ROMANS 3:19-20*

No. The Bible is clear that nobody has been, nor ever can be, saved by keeping the law. The law reveals the sin in our lives.

## 2 - HOW ARE WE SAVED? *EPHESIANS 2:8-9*

We are saved by God's grace. The only thing you can do is to accept salvation as a gift. Our works of obedience do not contribute to our salvation.

## 3 - DOES THAT MEAN GRACE ABOLISHED THE LAW? *TITUS 2:11-12*

No, the Bible says "*Do we then make void the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we establish the law.*" (Romans 3:31). After saving us, grace continues to lead us from sin to righteousness, so that we may "*serve God acceptably*". The grace of God always leads us to obedience, and away from sin (breaking the law).

## 4 - HOW DO WE SHOW GOD THAT WE LOVE HIM? *JOHN 14:15*

Keeping His commandments is our love response to Jesus. 1 John 4:19 says, "*We love Him because He first loved us.*" Our desire to keep God's law is a result of already being saved-- not a condition to be saved.

## 5 - WHAT ARE THE TEN COMMANDMENTS? *EXODUS 20:1-17*

The 10 Commandments are divided into two sections. The first four explain how to "*Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.*" Matthew 22:37. The last six explain how to "*Love your neighbor as yourself.*" Matthew 22:39.

**Note:** Before God gives the commandments, He reminds the Israelites that they have already been saved.

## 6 - HOW DOES JESUS APPLY THE LAW? *MATTHEW 5:21-22, 27-28*

Jesus makes it clear that the law is not only about our outward actions, but also concerns our thoughts and motives. It is possible to keep the letter of the law, while violating the spirit of the law. However, it is impossible to keep the spirit of the law while violating the letter.

## 7 - WHAT IS A GENUINE TEST OF KNOWING GOD? *1 JOHN 2:3-6*

Our attitude towards God's law reveals our true spiritual condition. Christianity is more than just saying you know God. Jesus is not just our Saviour, but also our Lord and when we love Him as such, our attitudes and actions change.

**Salvation leads us to loving obedience. God's children have been saved by grace, and they love God so much that they enthusiastically obey Him. They accept His standards of conduct. They are convinced that His ways are best. Won't you choose Jesus to be your Saviour and Lord, and take your stand with God's commandment-keeping people?**

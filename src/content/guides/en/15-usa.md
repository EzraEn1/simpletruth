## 1 - WHAT ARE THE IDENTIFYING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SECOND BEAST? *REVELATION 13:10-11*

**a. IT ARISES SOMETIME AROUND 1798**
  
  The Bible teaches that this new power was to emerge when the papacy went into captivity in 1798 (v. 11).

**b. IT COMES UP IN AN UNPOPULATED PART OF THE WORLD**

  In Bible prophecy, waters symbolise populated areas (Rev 17:15). This beast rises up out of the earth, the very opposite of the sea, thus representing an unpopulated area.

**c. IT IS A CHRISTIAN NATION**

  While the first beast is pagan in appearance (v. 2) this beast is like a lamb, the most common symbol of Jesus. Although this beast is not Christ-like, it initially appears to be so.

**d. IT IS A COUNTRY WITHOUT A KING (DEMOCRATIC-REPUBLIC)**

  The first beast has crowns on his horns (v. 1), while the second beast has none. This means that the second beast would not have a king.

**e. IT IS GOVERNED BY TWO SEPARATE POWERS OR PRINCIPLES**

  Horns are symbols of powers (Daniel 7:24; 8:21).

  Around the time the Papacy received its "*deadly wound*" (v. 3, 10) in 1798, the United States of America was forming as a fledgling nation, growing from a very small beginning to a position of worldwide power. It grew out of a remote area where no nation had existed before, and was established upon two principles, republicanism (a country without a king) and protestantism (a church without a pope). This prophecy clearly points to the rise of the United States of America.

## 2 - WHAT WILL AMERICA DO? *REVELATION 13:12-17*

America will behave like the Papacy did in the Dark Ages. The essence of the Papacy is its churchstate union (Catholicism & Rome). Although America arose as a nation that kept church and state separate, this prophecy predicts that America will revert to an image of the Papacy by uniting church and state once again (Protestantism & USA). In time, religious liberty will soon be followed by religious oppression in order to enforce Sunday observance. (See Mark of the Beast study)

## 3 - HOW DOES GOD CALL US TO FOLLOW HIM? *JEREMIAH 31:3*

In contrast to Satan, God draws us to Him with His love. True obedience cannot be coerced, it must be motivated by love. 

**At the end, the USA and apostate Protestantism will unite to force a form of worship. Although it may appear Christian at first, by its words and deeds it is evident that it is inspired by the same spirit of the antichrist. 
In contrast, Christ never coerces the will. God only wants worship that is freely given. Will you choose to worship Jesus today?**

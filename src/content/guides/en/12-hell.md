# HELL

## 1 - DOES GOD WANT TO DESTROY PEOPLE IN HELL? *2 PETER 3:9*

No. Destruction is a strange act for God (see Isaiah 28:21), as He has "*no pleasure in the death of the wicked*" (Ezekiel 33:11.) God desires all to be saved.

## 2 - WHO IS HELL INTENDED FOR? *MATTHEW 25:41*

Hell was intended for the devil and his angels. Nowhere in the Bible does it say that the devil is in charge of hell.

## 3 - WILL THERE BE ANY HUMANS IN HELL? *REVELATION 21:6-8*

God has done everything in His power that we may be saved, but unfortunately, not all will choose to receive this gift of life. If we refuse to be separated from our sin, we must be destroyed with it. God respects the choices we make.

## 4 - WHEN DOES HELL TAKE PLACE? *MATTHEW 13:39-40*

Jesus clearly taught that the wicked are destroyed at "*the end of the age*" (v39). This means that hell is a future event. Hell takes place at the end of the 1000 years (see 1000 years study).

## 5 - WHERE DOES HELL TAKE PLACE? *REVELATION 20:9*

Scripture clearly teaches that hell will take place on earthâ€“ not under it.

## 6 - HOW MUCH IS DESTROYED IN HELL? *MATTHEW 10:28*

Hell is the destruction of the entire being and is referred to in Scripture as the "*second death*"
(Revelation 21:8). This destruction is absolute and final.

**See also:** Malachi 4:1-3, John 3:16, Romans 6:23, Isaiah 47:14, Psalms 37:9-11, 20, Obadiah 1:16, 2 Peter
2:6, Jude 1:7

## 7 - WHY IS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE LOST NECESSARY? *NAHUM 1:9*
Sin has tarnished God's creation and has destroyed many of His creatures. This intruder must be
destroyed in order to save the world from its disastrous effects. Once God has done this, there will
be no more pain, hurt, or death ever again. This is because sin will never "*rise up a second time*". 

***"As I live,' says the Lord God, 'I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn, turn from your evil ways! For why should you die, O house of Israel?"* (Ezekiel 33:11.) Because God loves us all, He has made provision for all to be saved. Would you like to let go of the sins in your life and accept the life that Jesus is offering you?**

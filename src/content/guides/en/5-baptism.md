# BAPTISM

## 1 - HOW IMPORTANT IS BAPTISM? *MARK 16:15-16*

Very! Jesus stresses that baptism is a necessary step for someone who wants to follow Him.

## 2 - WHAT DOES BAPTISM LOOK LIKE? *MATTHEW 3:16-17*

When Jesus was baptised He "*came up immediately from the water*" (v. 16), which implies that He was first fully immersed in the water. Baptism is being completely covered under water.

## 3 - WHAT DOES BAPTISM SYMBOLISE? *ROMANS 6:3-6*

Baptism unites us in the death and resurrection of Jesus. It illustrates that our past has been washed away and we now have a new beginning in Christ.

## 4 - WHAT DOES BAPTISM ACHIEVE? *1 PETER 3:21*

Baptism allows us to have a good conscience toward God. There is nothing miraculous about the water, nor does it mean that we will never sin again. Rather, it is an acknowledgment that God is
good and has dealt with your past.

## 5 - WHAT ELSE HAPPENS WHEN YOU ARE BAPTISED? *ACTS 2:41-42, 47*

If you have been convicted of truth and "*cut to the heart*" (v. 37) and choose to follow God and "*repent*" (v. 38), then you are ready for baptism. It's actually quite simple!

## 6 - WHEN IS SOMEONE READY TO BE BAPTISED? *ACTS 2:37-38*

If you have been convicted of truth "*cut to the heart*" (v. 37) and choose to follow God "*repent*" (v. 38), then you are ready for baptism. It's actually quite simple!

## 7 - IF YOU ARE READY, SHOULD YOU WAIT? *ACTS 22:16*

No. Once you see the importance of following Jesus, you shouldn't wait or allow anything to stop you from making this decision.

**Baptism is an essential part of the Christian life, but it is truly only the beginning. For the person who has not been baptised, baptism should be the number one priority. There may be things to learn before baptism, but there should be no delay in getting started. Why are you waiting? Is it your desire to follow Jesus with all your heart and commit your life to Him through baptism?**

# CHURCH

## 1 - HOW IS GOD'S CHURCH DESCRIBED? *REVELATION 12:1-2*

In Bible prophecy, a woman is represented as a church (see Jeremiah 6:2 & 2 Corinthians 11:2). This woman is pure, representing God's true church.

## 2 - ARE THERE COUNTERFEITS TO GOD'S CHURCH? *REVELATION 17:4-5*

In contrast to the pure woman, this harlot woman clearly represents a corrupt church–the Papacy (see Antichrist study). Interestingly, this church is also depicted as the mother of many harlots, which represents other fallen churches. Rather than identifying the many counterfeits, we should seek to identify God's one true church.

## 3 - WHAT ARE THE IDENTIFYING MARKERS OF GOD'S TRUE CHURCH?

  **a. WORLDWIDE | MATTHEW 28:18-20**

  God's true church has a world-wide mission and is spread throughout the world.

  **b. THREE ANGELS' MESSAGES | REVELATION 14:6-11**

  God's true church preaches the three angels' messages in the context of the everlasting gospel. It calls God's people to worship the Creator on the Sabbath, and warns them against the teachings of Babylon and receiving the Mark of the Beast. This message will prepare the world for the second coming of Jesus.

  **c. COMMANDMENT-KEEPING | REVELATION 12:17; 14:12**

  God's true church keeps ALL the commandments of God (including the fourth– the Sabbath commandment).

  **d. SPIRITUAL GIFT OF PROPHECY | REVELATION 12:17; 19:10**

  The "*testimony of Jesus*" refers to the spiritual gift of prophecy. Just as the Old Testament church had prophets (Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Amos, etc.), the New Testament church also had prophets (Acts 11:27; 13:1; 15:32; 21:9-10), so too will God's end-time church continue to have the gift of prophecy.


The Seventh-day Adventist Church is the only church that fits these markers. It has nearly 23 million members in 202 countries (out of the 228 recognized by the U.N.). According to the World Council of Churches, it is "*probably the most widespread Protestant denomination, with work in over 200 countries…*" It is the only church that has been consistently preaching the three angels' messages for over 150 years. This church teaches the commandments of God, and believes that there is an end-time manifestation of the gift of prophecy.

## 4 - WHAT DOES GOD WANT YOU TO DO? *REVELATION 18:4*

God has His people throughout the world but He is calling them into His true church to preach the end-time message that will prepare the world for His soon return.


**God is inviting people of every nation to be a part of His church and take their stand with His commandment-keeping people. Today He is inviting you to join His church. Is it your desire to join the Seventh-day Adventist church?**
